    Create a 2 player shooting game.
    Each player has a health of 100.
    Players can shoot at each other with a random power (0-5) which will reduce the opponent's health.
    The Player whose health reaches 0, dies and the game ends.
    
    There are 5 such rounds, the player with the most game wins, wins the match/tournament.
    
    On the screen, there should be a button to start the game.
    Once the game finishes, it should update the current score.
    When a player wins 3 games, show the winner of the match.
