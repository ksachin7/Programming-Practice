# OOP(Object oriented programming)

JavaScript supports several object-oriented programming (OOP) features, although its implementation differs from classical OOP languages like Java or C++. Some of the OOP features supported by JavaScript include:

1. **Objects and Classes**: JavaScript supports objects as fundamental entities. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

2. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit. JavaScript supports encapsulation through closures, objects, and classes. Access modifiers like `public`, `private`, or `protected` are not natively supported, but can be emulated using conventions or ES6 features like private fields.

3. **Inheritance**: JavaScript supports inheritance through prototype-based inheritance and ES6 classes. Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype objects.

4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message in different ways. JavaScript supports polymorphism through method overriding and method overloading (even though it's not directly supported, it can be achieved using different techniques).

5. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding the complexity of an object and only showing the necessary features. JavaScript supports abstraction through objects, functions, and classes. You can also simulate abstract classes and methods using conventions.

6. **Modularity**: Modularity allows breaking down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces. JavaScript supports modularity through modules (CommonJS, AMD, and ES6 modules) and functions.

7. **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime. This allows for flexibility but can also lead to potential runtime errors if types are not handled properly.

8. **Prototype-Based Inheritance**: In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects. This is known as prototype-based inheritance and is a fundamental feature of the language.

While JavaScript's approach to OOP may differ from traditional OOP languages, it offers powerful features for building complex applications and systems in a flexible and dynamic manner.
